=== Set cloned array contents with for loop instead of allocating a new array and then calling oldArray.slice(0) ===
Rejecting this, because it's slower.

=== Grid stores data in Uint8Array ===
Rejecting this as same performance as above.

This surprised me.

=== Comment out lines that increment perfStats counters ===
Seems like this doesn't make too much of a difference.
