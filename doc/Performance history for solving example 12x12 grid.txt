=== Set cloned array contents with for loop instead of allocating a new array and then calling oldArray.slice(0) ===
Rejecting this, because it's slower.

=== Grid stores data in Uint8Array ===
Rejecting this as same performance as above.

This surprised me.

=== Comment out lines that increment perfStats counters ===
Seems like this doesn't make too much of a difference.

solveGrid: 17493.000ms main.js:91
Object {contradictionSearches: 0, contradictionSearchesPassed: 0, solveGridRecursiveCalls: 0} 

=== Use local variables instead of arrays to store per-row and per-column counts for 0s and 1s ===

Object {contradictionSearches: 1164771, contradictionSearchesPassed: 582386, solveGridRecursiveCalls: 1164771}

This is already ~60% faster, with no changes that required rewriting more than a few lines of code.

=== Added new stat contradictionSearchReachedIdenticalRowColComparison ===

=== Basic intra-row and intra-column contradiction checks only run on the dirty grid row or column ===
This now runs quickly enough that my laptop CPU fan doesn't have time to come on!
